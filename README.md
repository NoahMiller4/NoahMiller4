Hello, world. My name is Noah Miller. I am a software developer student in Manitoba with a love for tech. I often spend my time building pc's, coding, gaming, drumming and curling. I took one year of Computer Science at the University of Manitoba, and transfered to MITT for Software Development.

Before Software Development, I was in culinary arts, competition cooking, and backpacked Australia.

My known programming languages include : \
      - HTML\
      - CSS\
