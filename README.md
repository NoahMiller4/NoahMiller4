Hello, world! My name is Noah Miller. I am a software development student in Manitoba with a love for tech. I often spend my time building pc's, coding, gaming, drumming, cooking and curling. I studied Computer Science at the University of Manitoba, and transfered to MITT for Software Development.

Before Software Development, I was in culinary arts, competition cooking, and backpacked Australia. I aspire to work in tech, and am open to any valuable experience or tips in the field.

My known programming languages include: \
      - HTML\
      - CSS\
      - JavaScript\
      - C#\
      - React
